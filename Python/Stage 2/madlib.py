# Let's put it all together. Write code for the function process_madlib, which takes in
# a string "madlib" and returns the string "processed", where each instance of
# "NOUN" is replaced with a random noun and each instance of "VERB" is
# replaced with a random verb. You're free to change what the random functions
# return as verbs or nouns for your own fun, but for submissions keep the code the way it is!

# Lesson 2.6: Structured Data - Lists

# Similar to how strings are seuqences of characters, lists are
# sequences of anything! We can have lists of numbers, lists of
# characters, even lists of lists! And we can mix up the contents
# too so we can have lists containing many different things.

print p
print p[0]

# Lesson 2.6: For Loops

# For loops, like while loops, are useful for running a block of code
# multiple times. For loops make iterating through elements in a list
# easier than using a while loop.
