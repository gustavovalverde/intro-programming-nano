# Lesson 2.2: Variables

# Programmers use variables to represent values in their code.
# This makes code easier to read by telling others what values
# mean. It also makes code easier to write by cutting down on
# potentially complicated numbers that repeat in our code.

# We sometimes call numbers without a variable "magic numbers"
# It's best to reduce the amount of "magic numbers" in our code

speed_of_light = 299792458.0
billionth = 1.0 / 1000000000.0
nanostick = speed_of_light * billionth * 100
print nanostick

# Lesson 2.2: Strings

# Strings are sequences of characters that are enclosed in quotes.
# We can enclose them with single or double quotes and assign them
# to variables. We can even combine strings by adding them (we call
# this concatenation).

# https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-nd000/l-4192698630/m-48700403

print 'Hello'
print "Hello"

hello = "Howdy"
print hello

# This segment is just a chance for you to play around with
# finding strings within strings. Read through the code and
# press Test Run to see what it does. Is there anything
# interesting or unexpected?

print "Example 1: Finding substrings in a string"
print "test".find("te")
print "test".find("st")
print "test"[2:]

print "Example 2: Finding substrings in a string which is stored as a variable"
my_string = "test"
print my_string.find("te")
print my_string.find("st")
print my_string[2:]

print "Example 3: Printing out everything after a certain substring"
my_string = "My favorite color: blue"
color_start_location = my_string.find("color:")
favorite_color = my_string[color_start_location:]
print favorite_color # oops, this line prints out 'color: ' as well...
print favorite_color[7:] # this fixes it!

print "Example 4: Other interesting things about string.find()..."
print "text".find("text") # prints 0
print "text".find("Text") # prints -1
print "text".find("")     # prints 0
print "text".find(" ")    # prints -1


# Lesson 2.3: Procedures

# Functions (also known as procedures or methods) take input and return an output.
# Programmers use functions all the time! They may seem confusing at first but
# the more you use and make them, the better you'll get!

    return s[1:]

print rest_of_string('audacity')

# Lesson 2.4: Making Decisions - If Statements

# We'll often write programs that need to make comparisons between values.
# We can do comparisons just like we do in math with the < and > signs.
# We can also do equality comparisons with != (not equal) and ==.
# Comparisons always return a Boolean value (either True or False).

# https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-nd000/l-4196788670/e-48727556/m-48724313

print 2 < 3
print 21 < 3
print 7 * 3 < 21
print 7 * 3 != 21
print 7 * 3 == 21

# Lesson 2.4: While Loops

# Loops are an important concept in computer programming.
# Loops let us run blocks of code many times which can be
# really useful when we have to repeat tasks.
